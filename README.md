HateStack
=========

A public rant pile. 

## Description

HateStack is a public forum for angry rants you don't wish anyone to remember in 30 minutes' time. The front page contains a limited length "stack" of posts of a FILO order, and in addition, all posts are internally time stamped and will disappear into the ether 30 minutes after posting. The stack is stored only in the server's memory, meaning not even the server has any record of your rant once it's gone.
